If you would like to submit a FLIP, submit it as a [Pull Request](https://github.com/factland/FLIPs/pulls).

If you would like to get some feedback on the idea before submitting a FLIP, then continue opening an Issue as a thread for discussion or start a discussion on [Discussion](https://github.com/Factland/FLIPs/discussions). Discussing ideas before writing a FLIP is meant to save the potential author time since it is more efficient to discuss outside of a PR.

See the guidelines at [FLIP-1](./flip-1.md):
