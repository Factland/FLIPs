<p>FactLand Improvement Proposals (FLIPs), including informational, standards, governance and meta proposals.

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>First review <a href="FLIPS/flip-1">FLIP-1</a>. Then clone the repository and add your FLIP. There is a <a href="https://github.com/factland/FLIPs/blob/main/flip-template.md">template FLIP here</a>. Then submit a Pull Request to <a href="https://github.com/factland/FLIPs">FLIPs repository</a>.</p>

<h2>FLIP status</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Draft</strong> - The first  of a FLIP which is merged by an FLIP Editor into the repository when discussed and properly formatted.</li>
  <li><strong>Review</strong> - The Author marks a FLIP as ready for and requesting Peer Review.</li>
  <li><strong>Last Call</strong> - This is the final review for a FLIP before moving to FINAL. A FLIP editor will assign Last Call status and set a review end date (`last-call-deadline`), typically 14 days later. If this period results in necessary changes it will revert the FLIP to Review.</li>
  <li><strong>Final</strong> - This FLIP represents the final standard. A Final FLIP exists in a state of finality and should only be updated to correct errata and add non-normative clarifications.</li>
  <li><strong>Stagnant</strong> - Any FLIP in Draft or Review if inactive for a period of 6 months or greater is moved to Stagnant. A FLIP may be resurrected from this state by Authors or FLIP Editors through moving it back to Draft.</li>
  <li><strong>Withdrawn</strong> - The FLIP Author(s) have withdrawn the proposed FLIP. This state has finality and can no longer be resurrected using this FLIP number. If the idea is pursued at later date it is considered a new proposal.</li>
  <li><strong>Living</strong> - A special status for FLIPs that are designed to be continually updated and not reach a state of finality. This includes most notably FLIP-1.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FLIP Types</h2>

<p>FLIPs are separated into a number of types, and each has its own list of FLIPs.</p>

<p>Describes a FactLand issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the FactLand community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational FLIPs do not necessarily represent community consensus or a recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational FLIPs.</p>

<h3><a href="{{"standard"|relative_url}}">Standard</a>({{site.pages|where:"type","Standard"|size}})</h3>
<p>Describes any change that affects the FactLand processes or implementations.

<h3><a href="{{"governance"|relative_url}}">Governance</a>({{site.pages|where:"type","Govenrance"|size}})</h3>
<p>Describes any change that affects the FactLand governance.

<h3><a href="{{"meta"|relative_url}}">Meta</a> ({{site.pages|where:"type","Meta"|size}})</h3>
